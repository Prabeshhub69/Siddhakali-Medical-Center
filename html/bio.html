            <p class="about-text">
                I'm an entrepreneur passionate about making quality healthcare accessible to everyone. While
                I'm not a medical professional myself, I recognized a need in our community for a healthcare
                facility that truly puts people first. My role is to build and manage the infrastructure,
                operations, and business side of things, so our talented doctors and nurses can focus on
                what they do best—caring for patients.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
                Before founding this medical center, I spent years in business management and healthcare
                administration, learning what it takes to run efficient, patient-centered facilities. These
                days, you'll find me overseeing daily operations, managing our incredible team of medical
                professionals, handling finances and partnerships, and constantly looking for ways to improve
                our services. When I'm not at the center, I'm probably meeting with stakeholders, planning
                expansion strategies, or spending quality time with my family.

                    "Healthcare is not just about treating illness—it's about building relationships, understanding
                    people,
                    and being there when they need us most. Every patient has a story, and it's our privilege to be part
                    of their journey to better health."
